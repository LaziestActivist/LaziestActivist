- 👋 Hi, I’m @LaziestActivist
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a greate specialist and... I know, I know it's not what I'm supposed to say, but I have nothing to say. There is no hobby that I'm keen on. May be someday.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, HTML and started a Math Analysis course made myself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing. I will complement this part later.
- 📫 How to reach me: sushintsev.vd@gmail.com
